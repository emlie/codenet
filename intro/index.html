        <h1>hello!</h1>
        <p>
          <span class="blue">I'm Mia</span>, and I'm a Norwegian 17 year-old (born in 2000) who loves everything coding and design related. I'm a curious person and I'm interested in everything from technology to ancient history. I play tennis every week and enjoy reading too. At school, the classes I take are informatics, physics, chemistry and theoretical math. I also take French classes and am self-studying Korean. It would be ideal to study aeronautical engineering. However, my country doesn't offer that university course and I'm not too sure about studying in England yet (because of the hefty price and student loan), I am working hard to get into NTNU and take a master's degree in materials science.
          <br />
          <br />
          <span class="blue">I fell in love with coding in 2013</span>, and my interest in web design and programming has only grown over the years. As of now, I am comfortable with HTML and CSS. I am learning Sass and Ruby and also getting more into Javascript and jQuery. I would also love to explore Python and possibly other programming languages.
          <br />
          I love browsing on dribbble and behance and getting inspired. I prefer light and simple or minimalistic designs, but I also really like loud and colorful designs as well. I find inspiration in almost everything, and I enjoy looking at different icon and logo designs, different UI and anything design related.
          <br />
          <br />
          <span class="blue">I hope that we in codenet will connect well and talk a lot with each other</span>. Although I know I'm not the best at that, I'll try my best!
